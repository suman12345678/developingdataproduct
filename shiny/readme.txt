created ui.R and server.r in a folder
setwd() as that one
runApp() will run the application in local 

then I have tried the below:. 
Created token from shinyapps
Install rsconnect,shinny
runApp()
then click publish button 
But unfortunately getting message while doing that. So couldnot do it but my codes are fine in local.
So please let me know how can I deploy this simply please dont mark it less.
